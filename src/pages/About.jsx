    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a 16 year old software engineer. This is my first "real" project with react that I didn't use a tutorial for
      and completed entirely on my own. While I may not have liked it, it was a great learning experience. Anyways enough
      about me this page it really to explain what the purpose of this website is. It's simply to document my journey as a software engineer.
      Every time I finish reading a book that is relevant to software engineering or a project. I will document it here,
      even if I don't finish a project. I might right a blog post on it such as if I complete a piece of a project that was very difficult.
      I might document it explain why I struggled how I solved it and/or how I'm planning on improving my existing code.

    <h2>About the website</h2>
    <p>
      I saw Strapi and thought it was cool so I decided to use that as the CMS. It was hella easy to use very simple
      and user-friendly UI. React was the Frontend Framework I decided to use was it the best option absolutely not.
      Does it increase my chances of getting a job yeah. I know there are probably lot's of spelling and grammatical errors. I'm a programmer 
      not a journalist deal with it.
