# First React Project
This is my first project built with React without a tutorial. I know the code isn't the best and it makes lots of HTTP requests but I consider this a start.

To run the project:
```
npm run dev
```
You also have to install the Strapi Headless CMS which is another git repository of mine but uuh I didn't want to share it.

## What I learned
I know the website looks horrible especially to an experienced developer however I learned a lot from making it. React Routing, HTTP Requests in React, Markdown with React, etc. I hope to learn much more.

## Why I used React
I want a job plain and simple. I never really liked React I always felt that it over complicates simple tasks. I still feel this way after having used it. However I no longer hate it yes React is very powerful and can be used to create amazing websites. But it is still very complicated and if not used correctly can create shitty websites like this one.
